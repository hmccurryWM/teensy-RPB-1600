# Teensy-RPB-1600
Arduino Library for communicating with and programming the Meanwell RPB-1600 via PMBus with a Teensy 4.0. While this library was designed for use with the Teensy 4.0, it's written on top of the Wire library and should be usable other Arduino hardware. I've been using it as part of [this project](https://github.com/maland16/citicar-charger). In the absence of any real documentation (yet) that project, and the curve configurator in this repo, can serve as examples of how to use this library.  

## How to use this library

## Curve Configurator  
This example arduino sketch can be used to read data from and write data to the RPB-1600 over the PMBus protocol. More details to come...

## PMBus i2c Protocol
